FaceServer is a real-time face recognition backend powered by FastAPI, supporting both HTTP and WebSocket protocols. It includes anti-spoofing and depth verification mechanisms, making it ideal for secure identity verification systems.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone http://gitserver/t0667/faceserver.git
cd faceserver
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Start the Server

```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the FastAPI server on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`

### WebSocket API Usage

To integrate face recognition into your frontend:

- Connect to the WebSocket endpoint:
```txt
ws://0.0.0.0:8000/ws
```

- Send image frames in `bytes` format.
- The server will respond with an array of detected face labels:
```json
[
  {"label": "person1"},
  {"label": "person2"}
]
```
